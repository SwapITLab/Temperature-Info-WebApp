# Temperature-Info-WebApp

The Temperature Monitoring System is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to provide real-time temperature information across various locations in the city. The system features two primary interfaces that work together to deliver temperature data in an accessible and user-friendly manner. The first interface is an interactive temperature map that visualizes temperature data across 20 key locations. This map uses a color-coded system where red markers indicate hot spots (≥37°C), orange for moderate temperatures (≥35°C), and green for cooler areas (<35°C). Each location on the map is clickable, providing detailed information including exact coordinates and timestamps of temperature readings.

The second interface is an intelligent chatbot that allows users to query temperature information using natural language. This chatbot can provide various types of information, such as specific location temperatures, identify hotspots and cool spots across the city, calculate average temperatures, and pinpoint areas with the highest and lowest temperatures. The system is built with modern web development tools and frameworks, ensuring smooth performance and reliable data handling. The application is designed to be responsive and accessible across different devices, making it easy for users to monitor temperature variations throughout the city. Whether users prefer visual data representation through the map or conversational interaction through the chatbot, the system provides multiple ways to access and understand temperature patterns across different areas.

Temperature Map:

The Temperature Map is an interactive visualization tool that displays real-time temperature data across different locations. It features a color-coded system where red markers indicate hot spots (≥37°C), orange for moderate temperatures (≥35°C), and green for cooler areas (<35°C). Users can click on any location to view detailed information including exact coordinates and timestamps of temperature readings. The map provides a clear visual representation of temperature distribution, making it easy to identify temperature patterns and variations across different areas.

Temperature Chatbot:

The Temperature Chatbot is an intelligent conversational interface that allows users to query temperature information using natural language. Users can ask questions about specific locations, find hotspots (areas with temperature ≥37°C), identify cool spots (areas with temperature <35°C), get average temperatures, or locate areas with the highest and lowest temperatures. The chatbot provides real-time responses with detailed temperature data, making it easy for users to quickly access the information they need through simple text-based interactions.
